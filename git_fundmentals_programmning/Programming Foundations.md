# Programming Foundations: Fundamentals by 
### annyce davis android google developer/expert

- what is programming? converting idea to computer program ( instructions)
- instructions::must be literals,order matters.
- bug:unexpected output
- crash :programm stop early or freezes
- programming lanuguages??hundereds if not thousands ,with syntax in each one to express common instructions in all languages.
- why there is alot of programming languages especially they do the same?there are weakness and strenghthen like dealing with limited memory and big one devices calculator and super computer0)
- writing source code?? 
1. must be in plain text not rich text(italic,bold..)
2. file in an extension ![[tomove/Pasted image 20220426165612.png]]
3. in text editor or ide(better for development ex:debug and compile) ::xcode to mac devices
- source code to machinecode(to run in any deevice to need to script)?
4. compiling:highlevel to machincode
5. interpreting:
6. mixed:

 ## which programminglang we chhose?
  - common ::c++,c#,js,python,java
  - fewer syntax,most readable :python,js
  - js--webapps,nonweb
  - **python**--games,webapps,scientific analysis,internal company tools(gneral purpose)
  ## downloading python?

  1. donot forget add to path or default path
  2. install thr interpeter with it I (begin with python3 )
  3. alaways use the latest
- exit python promt using ctrl+d / exit()
- run file ---python3+file
## vscode install::
- to work with python install python extension called python.(syntax highlighting)
- choose the interpreter from command pallate::cmd+shift+p python choose interpreter
- open a project  it adds  a .vscode meta data 
- you can run selected portion af script.
## syntax 
### any expresiip:keyword,expression,operator
- operator (tell it to operatoe an operation on two operands)
- operator+ operands is an expression.
- default,python excute the arthmatic expressions in the priority rules ![[tomove/Pasted image 20220426173727.png]]
- statments are any thing in(print thing,mathamtical expression,chioc)
## troubleshooting issues
![[tomove/Pasted image 20220426174253.png]]

- types 
- ![[tomove/Pasted image 20220426174707.png]]
1. print(heeo) ---- seach whole the program
2. 5/0 ----searvch the message
3. print("hello,username" ) instead print("hello",username ) ----search whole script

## how to store data name,number?
 using variables : 
 var = 50 --int 
 var="sd" --str
 python interpertre teels you the type easly
## deal with numbers
- 12 /,*,-,+,//,%,** 20
- 1.5/1.2--default ::huge float number 
## deal with strings
- var= " " 
- print("  ")
- print("df 'f' ")
- to use "" inside string --use ' ' on the whole
- to use ' ' inside string --use " " on the whole
- print('vv"fv"ff')
- print("df'f'fwe")
- use the common "string " version

## white spaces
 - in alot of cases it makes code readalbe
 - in certian cases related to keuwords it leads to syntax error 
 - ex::
  ` ifanswer == "yes"`

## comments 
start with # tag
## making decision with boalean expressions(true,false)
- 5 == 4 -->false
- other relational oprators <,>,!=,=>,<= ![[tomove/Pasted image 20220426222044.png]]
- 
## if statment

``` python
    if 5<6: 
    #  the tw print statments is in one block (because of the same identation)
      print(1)     
      print(2) 
    else: #else clause (necause must have an if before it)
```
  

## if statmentsdifferent languages:

# introducion to functions
- easy to debug
- called routines ,methdos in other languages #understand 
- types:: (return value,parameter) combinatorics 4 types
``` python
def func (x):#x is a parameter
      print(x)
func(x)#x is an arguments

```
- **Setting parameters and arguments**One thing to note is that sometimes parameters and arguments are used interchangeably, you'll have to rely are used interchangeably, you'll have to rely on the context to figure out the meaning, but don't despair, the key thing to know but don't despair, the key thing to know is that functions have the ability to change their behavior is that functions have the ability to change their behavior based on their parameters and arguments. based on their parameters and arguments  #understand
- u can use the function to return values rusing  return  key word and store te return value in a variable .
- func in java

- in kotlin ![[tomove/Pasted image 20220426231202.png]] 
- in rupy ![[tomove/Pasted image 20220426231422.png]] 
- java script ![[tomove/Pasted image 20220426231543.png]]
- ## compare new lamgaues you learn .
## explring  languages
- c is the basic of c++,java,python
- c used in games,other langues compilers,operating systems
- java in desktop and mobile apps ,every thing called class
- c++ in games,game engines
- swift,objective-c in mobile
- ruby,javascript in web


## next steps

- python essential training
- local meetup group
- online language community
- pracise and use what  yuo learnt
